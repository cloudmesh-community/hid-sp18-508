\section{openVZ}
OpenVZ is a container-based virtualization for Linux. OpenVZ creates multiple
secure, isolated Linux containers (otherwise known as VEs or VPSs) on a single
physical server enabling better server utilization and ensuring that
applications do not conflict. Each container performs and executes exactly
like a stand-alone server; a container can be rebooted independently and have
root access, users, IP addresses, memory, processes, files, applications,
system libraries and configuration files.

OpenVZ is free open source software, available under GNU GPL\cite{www-openvz}.
