Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)~\cite{www-amazonec2}is 
a web service. It can provide secure service in the cloud, which is
easier for developers to do cloud computing.

Amazon EC2 has lots of benefits. First, it is inexpensive, it only 
costs a very low rate for the compute capacity. Second, it is easy to
start. It contains several ways to get started with Amazon EC2. Third,
Amazon EC2 provides a highly reliable environment. ``The service runs 
within Amazonâ€™s proven network infrastructure and data centers.''~\cite{www-amazonec2}.
What's more, Amazon EC2 and Amazon VPC works together to provide high
security. ``Cloud security at AWS is the highest priority.''~\cite{www-amazonec2}.


Amazon EC2 allow developers to scale capacity quickly, which reduces
the time to just several minutes when obtaining and booting new server
instances.
